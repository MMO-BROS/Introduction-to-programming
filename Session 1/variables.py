# ---------------- Variable names ----------------------
# In python it is customary to start variable names with a lower-case letter
# If it has more than one word, replace spaces with an underscore: _
this_is_an_example_variable = "Some value"

# It is good to have short variable names, but it is most important
# that it is immediately understandable what the variable is used for


# ---------------- Constant names ----------------------
# If you have a variable that you know is never going to change
# it should be named with only upper-case letters
CONSTANT_VALUE = "Constant value"

# This is useful for variables that you know you will use many places
# That way you can simply change what the constant is assinged as, and it will be updated everywhere


# ---------------- Assinging values ----------------------
# Integer, a whole number, not decimal
a = 1

# Float, decimal number
b = 1.5

# Boolean, a value that is either True or False
c = False

# String, just a fancy word for text, needs to be surrounded by either double-quotes: "text"
# or single-quotes: 'text'
d = "Some text"

# Lists, they simply contain a number of items in some order
# Lists are intialised with square-brackets, and each items in it is separated by a comma
# They are not limmited to a single type of variables
letters_before_f = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", 256, False]
