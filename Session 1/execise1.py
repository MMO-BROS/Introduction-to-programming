# Write some code to complete each task.

# Task 1: Make a variable that contains the value 9, and print it


# Task 2: Make two variables and check whether they are the same


# Task 3: Check whether the two previous variables are NOT the same


# Task 4: Print all the numbers from 0 to (and including) 10, without typing any other number than 0 and 10
# Hint: Use a while loop


# Task 5 (advanced): Print every other number from 0 to 10 using a while loop
# For example: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
# Hint: Try to use an if statement
